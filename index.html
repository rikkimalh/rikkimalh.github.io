		You've heard of Batman, Superman, the The Joker and Catwoman. Ever heard of Condiment Man? How about Ambush Bug, or The Question? Yes, they are real fictional characters in the DC Universe and I am here to introduce you to a bunch more DC Superheroes and Supervillians that you probably have never heard of. As a reminder, <em>these superheroes are real and have indeed appeared in the comics.</em> No, I did not know any of this by heart. I am just as amazed as you are.

	I'm not really a fan of the site, too simple and a bit clunky for my taste but great source and hysterical content is what drew me to it for this project. <br>

	They use some pretty straight forward HTML, combined with tons of CSS to make it pretty (kind of obvious, it's an article after all.) One thing that is new to me is the figcaption tag. I'm thinking it adds a caption right below the image.
