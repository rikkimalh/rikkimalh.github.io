		You've heard of Batman, Superman, the The Joker and Catwoman. Ever heard of Condiment Man? How about Ambush bug, or The Question? Yes, they are all real fictional characters in the DC Univers and I am here to show you a bunch more DC Superheroes and Supervillians that you probably have never heard of. As a reminder, <em>these superheroes are real and have appeared in comics.</em> No, I did not know any of this by heart. I am just as amazed as you are.
